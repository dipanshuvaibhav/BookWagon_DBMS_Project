1.Identification of needs:
requirements for making the project:
- a good functional team which will be able to distribute the work and complete tasks efficiently
- book suppliers which will partner with us 
- good logistics system for efficient delivery of product.
- initial members to start the cycle of the business.
 
2.premliminary investigation:
-existing software systems that exists are:
+DoorstepBooks
+Justbooks
+Booklender
these sites provide a smooth renting service in specific locations depending on their collection of books which they buy from certain publishing houses. 

Downsides of the current book renting system:
-The current systems lack the formation of the reader community.
-The reviews are mostly from the point of view of a client unlike the intellectual analysis in the form of a blog that we aim to create.
-The User experience is rather uninteresting and complicated.
-The current systems do not give the members of the community the option to lend their books and earn.
Our system also puts together features to ensure better service in the basis of security. 

why is our system a little better than them:
-we aim on having a good reader community by having a blog base
-the blog system helps clients to share their views on different books which will help share other people's views.
-better ui
-helping everyone earn a little.

3.Feasibility study:
-project scope: scope of the project is to give the reader community a platform where they can rent books and form a freindly community where the members can share their views on other books and also provide everyone a mode to earn a little.
- factors needed to make the project possible:
 + good planning and team work
 + book publishers and small lenders that will partner with the business
 + good logistics system that will make the delivery of the books smooth.
